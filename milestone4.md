The changes on UI skeleton are mostly with the header and kitchen page. We changed the display layout from flex to grid, and modified the css so that each block aligns with each other correctly. Instead of having a simple border to divide each element, we add actual css styles to most of the elements on home page. We added a modal to the __Add Ingredient__ button. For stylistic purposes, we unified the button style and themed colors.
