# Milestone 3
Our homepage is similar to the Paper Prototype 1 from Milestone 2. It depicts the UI skeleton of a virtual "kitchen" that displays. The home page and main feature of Prototype 1 was the "fridge" concept. Users could input what food and ingredients they already owned at home into their online "fridge." The interface was based off a kitchen, with a __Spice Rack__, __Cupboard__, and __Fridge__. In future Milestones, we hope to combine ideas from our two paper prototypes. Prototype 2 focused on exploring different recipes based on the items/ingredients already in a user's "fridge." The home page was based off more typical recipe websites. We decided a home page with an emphasis on aspects from both prototypes would showcase the unique qualities of our website in comparison to other recipe websites. The home page would show that users could input what ingredients they already had and easily find recipes that completely or mostly contained those ingredients.
