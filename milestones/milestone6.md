## UI Improvements
We have improved the UI since the last Milestone by adding vector graphics of kitchen items. We have changed the theme colors to match the logo. We also created a better way to visualize the ingredient data from recipes.

## Data Visualizations
We visualize the data using our Food API. When a user chooses a recipe they want to create, they can see how the percentage of ingredients used in the recipe. It's just a little bit more interesting than the standard list of ingredients.
