# Milestone 3
Our homepage is similar to the Paper Prototype 1 from Milestone 2. It depicts the UI skeleton of a virtual "kitchen" that displays. The home page and main feature of Prototype 1 was the "fridge" concept. Users could input what food and ingredients they already owned at home into their online "fridge." The interface was based off a kitchen, with a __Spice Rack__, __Cupboard__, and __Fridge__. In future Milestones, we hope to combine ideas from our two paper prototypes. Prototype 2 focused on exploring different recipes based on the items/ingredients already in a user's "fridge." The home page was based off more typical recipe websites. We decided a home page with an emphasis on aspects from both prototypes would showcase the unique qualities of our website in comparison to other recipe websites. The home page would show that users could input what ingredients they already had and easily find recipes that completely or mostly contained those ingredients.

## Screen 1

Here is a user's main dashboard. It seperates all the ingredients that can found in their kitchen into items that are in their refrigerator, spice rack, and cupboards. Users add to or remove from this list according to what can be found in their kitchen. The button at the bottom uses the listed ingredients to find suitable recipes and sends the user to screen 2.

## Screen 2
![ss2](https://github.com/ReventonC/COGS121Project/blob/master/screenshots/m3Screen2.png)
This screen has a list of recipes based on the user's given list, with screenshots and small descriptions of type of dish and its main ingredients. Users can click a recipe to read more about it. Clicking a recipe sends the user to screen 3.

## Screen 3

This screen is the detailed view of an individual recipe. It will include the recipe description, pictures, its ingredients, how to cook it and any relevant web links to view the recipe elsewhere.

## Screen 4
![ss4](https://github.com/ReventonC/COGS121Project/blob/master/screenshots/m3Screen4.png)
If a user has not logged in or has logged out, this is the screen they will see. It serves as a screen 0, as well as an exit screen. The login button leads to screen 1, the user's dashboard. This screen can also be accessed by clicking the log out button, which exists on screen 5.

## Screen 5
![ss5](https://github.com/ReventonC/COGS121Project/blob/master/screenshots/m3Screen5.png)
This screen shows the user's profile and account settings. It can be accessed by clicking the button on the top-right on screens 1, 2 and 3. The log out button on the bottom takes the user to screen 4.
