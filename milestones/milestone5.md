# Milestone 5

## User Action 1:
Lets pretend that you have two houses. Make two accounts and log in. Create your kitchen based on what you envision by adding
ingredients. Do the same for your second account. Realize that you forgot to add an ingredient on your first account, so go
back and do that.

## User Action 2:
Make a new account and create a dish. Add any ingredients you would like in the kitchen to any category. Click on "Make a Meal!"
Now, select the ingredient that you would like to make.

We made edits to the UI by changing up the layout and CSS to look more aesthetically pleasing. Such edits include
adding a background and adding an image to the account details page. We also added a pantry logo to the top left 
of every page. From the last checkpoint, we also updated the add ingredients modal to be functional and have options.
We also created a Recipe Result page to show the recipe to the users (the recipe is hard coded there for now).
