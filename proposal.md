Proposals:
	A. The app would help us track an individual’s expenses. People would be encouraged to track their own expenses and add purchases they make and balances for bank and credit cards. People would be able to choose to make their profile public, but anonymous, to compare their spending habits to others’. People would be able to compare to others in different categories, such as different age groups, locations, socio-economic class, and ethnic groups. People could also see graphs and trends about their own expenses and be offered recommendations. Analysis of expenses could be a huge benefactor for many.

	B. This app idea could also be used with our recipe idea. People could track food expenses and see how much they spend on certain types of food and how to allocate money to all the different foods on their grocery lists. People can then buy ingredients accordingly and would know which ingredients to buy to create certain recipes. If they had a recipe in mind, they would know its price based on all the previously collected pricing on ingredients. Since the recipe idea helps you come up with recipes based on the ingredients you have, this app could also come up with the cheapest amount of things you can buy to add to your current ingredients to create the best possible recipe.
