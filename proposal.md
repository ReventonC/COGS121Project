Proposals:
        The app would help us track an individual’s expenses. People would be encouraged to track their own expenses and add purchases they make and balances for bank and credit cards. People would be able to choose to make their profile public, but anonymous, to compare their spending habits to others’. People would be able to compare to others in different categories, such as different age groups, locations, socio-economic class, and ethnic groups. People could also see graphs and trends about their own expenses and be offered recommendations. Analysis of expenses could be a huge benefactor for many.


        This app idea could also be used with our recipe idea. People could track food expenses and see how much they spend on certain types of food and how to allocate money to all the different foods on their grocery lists. People can then buy ingredients accordingly and would know which ingredients to buy to create certain recipes. If they had a recipe in mind, they would know its price based on all the previously collected pricing on ingredients. Since the recipe idea helps you come up with recipes based on the ingredients you have, this app could also come up with the cheapest amount of things you can buy to add to your current ingredients to create the best possible recipe.

Other Ideas: 
* best things to order in specific restaurants
   * Users can input a restaurant and from there, he/she can see the full menu. From there, the user will be able to see a like/dislike ratio for the items there. Users can rate and comment on certain food items.
   * Ideas (emojis instead of ratings?)


This web app would suggest recipes based on specific user inputs. Users can find suitable recipes with restrictions or filters such as caloric intake, what ingredients a user already has in their fridge, or time needed. Each recipe will provide statistics on the approximate nutritional value, average time of cooking, and average price of meal. This app will have different interactions on its web and mobile versions.


* what to cook based off of user input
   * Users can use this app to determine what foods to cook. There will be a list of questions such as calorie count and time to get an idea of what the user wants. A list of items will then be generated as suggestions for what the user can cook.
   * Stats about how much nutrient (approximately) intake, time of cooking, spending, etc
   * Different interaction on webpage and mobile side.


* Using some sort of government or military data to produce useful content
   * Maybe find and list all available military contracts


* An app that helps you get to your destination on time all the time
   * This app calculates the time you should start to get ready before heading to your place using the Google API. Users enter how long they think they will take to get ready as well as how long it will take for them to actually walk from the parking lot to the actual destination. If traffic suddenly gets worse, an alarm will alert the user that he/she should get ready sooner due to traffic.


* Recording your gas expense (maybe we can combine with personal tracker which is 3 ideas below this)
   * Recording the mileage you drive, money spent on gas, maybe calculating mpg or something to give advice on car service/inspection 
* Monitor human behaviors
   * See how many words someone types all day
   * Most visited websites among people
   * Other usage habits
* Fitness tracking. Distance, steps, heart rates, path they took
   * Maybe specialize this for going to the beach. For surfers. Wave sizes, amount surfed, temperature, time of day.
   * People exercising at the beach. Amount they ran, stretches or free body weight exercises they did
* Person objectives tracker
   * Track homework and upcoming assignments
   * Track gym exercise routines
   * Goals
   * Track and monitor expenses
   * Other things we can track and input data to daily, and maybe provide analysis for
   * (maybe we should just keep to one idea: expenses)
